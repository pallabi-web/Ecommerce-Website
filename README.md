# ✨ Kilangi - High-End Jewelry E-Commerce Landing Page

I designed and developed this landing page for **Kilangi**, a luxury jewelry brand specializing in gold and silver pieces adorned with emeralds and pearls. 

## 💍 The Design Concept
I moved away from deep, dark tones to a "Timeless Luxury" palette featuring creams, soft whites, and emerald greens to highlight the jewelry's brilliance. The goal was to create a clean, modern interface that makes the products the focal point.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **HTML5 & CSS3**: I structured the layout using semantic elements and modern CSS for a polished look.
* **Responsive Design**: I ensured the jewelry gallery scales beautifully for mobile and desktop users.
* **JavaScript Interactivity**: I added custom scripts to handle common e-commerce behaviors.

### JavaScript Features I Included:
* **Sticky Navigation**: I wrote a script that monitors the scroll position to keep the navigation bar at the top once the user scrolls past the promo bar.
* **Search Functionality**: I added a listener to the search input so it can filter products or show a dropdown of "Trending Searches" in the jewelry categories.
* **Smooth Transitions**: I implemented an Intersection Observer to trigger subtle fade-in animations for the hero text "Because You Deserve to Feel Timeless" as the page loads.
* **Cart Preview**: I created a simple toggle function for the cart icon to show a preview of selected luxury items without leaving the current page.
